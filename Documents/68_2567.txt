The patient has attended physical therapy from 11/16/06 to 11/21/06.  The patient has 3 call and cancels and 3 no shows.  The patient has been sick for several weeks due to a cold as well as food poisoning, so has missed many appointments.





SUBJECTIVE:  
The patient states pain still significant, primarily 1st seen in the morning.  The patient was evaluated 1st thing in the morning and did not take his pain medications, so objective findings may reflect that.  The patient states overall functionally he is improving where he is able to get out in the house and visit and do activities outside the house more.  The patient does feel like he is putting on more muscle girth as well.  The patient states he is doing well with his current home exercise program and feels like pool therapy is also helping as well.





OBJECTIVE: 
 Physical therapy has consisted of:
1.  Pool therapy incorporating endurance and general lower and upper extremity strengthening.
2.  Clinical setting incorporating core stabilization and general total body strengthening and muscle wasting.
3.  The patient has just begun this, so it is on a very beginners level at this time.

A 52-year-old male referred to physical therapy secondary to chronic back pain, weakness, and debilitation secondary to chronic pain.  The patient presents today having missed numerous appointments due to illness as well as no shows.  The patient does feel he is benefiting currently from ___ with increased ability to leave home and visit outside the home, thus feel like he is putting on some muscle at this time.  The patient's strength decreased today possibly secondary to being tested in the morning and patient did not take his pain medication though was very antalgic with all testing.  This may not give a clear presentation of comparison to the last session.
